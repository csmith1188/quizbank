Response Format
All endpoints return JSON responses. For list endpoints (without an ID at the end), the response includes an array of objects with id and name properties.

Example response for /course/1/section:

json
Copy code
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Section1"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Section2"
    }
]
For detail endpoints (with an ID at the end), the response includes the full object with all its properties.

Multiple Resource Responses
When requesting multiple resources (using + separated IDs), the API returns a combined response:

Multiple Units:

json
Copy code
{
    "id": "1+2",
    "name": "Combined Units: Unit1, Unit2",
    "units": [...]
}
Multiple Tasks:

json
Copy code
{
    "id": "2+3",
    "name": "Combined Tasks: Task2, Task3",
    "tasks": [...],
    "hierarchy": {...}
}
Rate Limiting
The API includes rate limiting to prevent abuse:

Limit: 100 requests per minute per IP address

Window: 1 minute

Headers: Rate limit information is included in response headers

üóÑÔ∏è Database Seeding
The API uses Sequelize with SQLite for its database.
A data.json file and a seed.js script are included to populate the database with sample data.

JSON Structure
The JSON file mirrors the database hierarchy:

json
Copy code
{
  "courses": [
    {
      "name": "Course1",
      "sections": [
        {
          "name": "Section1",
          "units": [
            {
              "name": "Unit1",
              "tasks": [
                {
                  "name": "Task1",
                  "questions": [
                    {
                      "ai": true,
                      "prompt": "What does the kanji Êó• mean?",
                      "correctAnswer": "Sun",
                      "correctIndex": 0,
                      "answers": ["Sun", "Tree", "Water", "Mountain"]
                    }
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Running the Seeder
Ensure dependencies are installed:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the seeding script:

bash
Copy code
node db/seed.js
The script will:

Drop and recreate all tables (sequelize.sync({ force: true })).

Insert courses, sections, units, tasks, and questions from data.json.

Automatically generate primary keys and wire up all foreign key relationships.

Notes
IDs in the JSON file are not required ‚Äî Sequelize auto-generates them.

The hierarchy is preserved:
Course ‚Üí Section ‚Üí Unit ‚Üí Task ‚Üí Question

Foreign key constraints are enforced in the database with cascading deletes (e.g. deleting a course also deletes its sections, units, tasks, and questions).
